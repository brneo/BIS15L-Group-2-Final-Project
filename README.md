#### Group project for group #2: COVID-19 and Diet Correlation 
AUTHORS: Brian Rezende, Margarita Ibarra, Byron Corado Perez, Mildred Hernandez (MVP)

In this project our group analyzed combined data of different types of food, world population obesity and undernourished rate, and global COVID-19 cases count from around the world. The dataset we worked with already calculated fat quantity, energy intake (kcal), food supply quantity (kg), and protein for different categories of food (all calculated as percentage of total intake amount). They also added on the obesity and undernourished rate (also in percentage) for comparison. The end of the datasets also included the most up to date confirmed/deaths/recovered/active cases (also in percentage of current population for each country).

We as a group aligned ourselves with the goal of this dataset, which set out to learn more about how a healthy diet could help combat the Corona Virus. From the dataset, we can gather information regarding diet patterns from countries with lower COVID infection rate, and adjust our own diet accordingly. Thus in this repository you will see us explore the question: Is there a correlation between COVID-19 disease development and daily food intake?
